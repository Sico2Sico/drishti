# Hunter need stand-alone toolchain that will not depend
# on any ANDROID_* variables:
# * https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/overview/customization/toolchain-id.html

# To achieve this we need to make a 4 steps:
# * Lock CMake variables that coming from Gradle build
# * Include original Android toolchain from NDK
# * Tweak variables to match CMake 3.7.1+ format
# * Add any custom user variables

# STEP 1: Lock variables from Gradle build
